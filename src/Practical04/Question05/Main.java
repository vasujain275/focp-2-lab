// Write a program to calculate the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). All numbers and return values should be of type double.
// Definition of Done:
//DoD 1: Two java files to be defined. One for class definitions and another for the application
//DoD 2: A class point is defined with two float variables for x1 and x2 and the following functionality:
//
//i. Non-parametrized and parameterized constructors are defined.
//ii. Get and set methods are defined for all the instance variables.
//iii. Distance function is defined to calculate the distance between two points.
//iv. Display function is defined with width of 7 and precision of 2.
//Write this program with a static method definition for calculating the distance between two points.
// This is for main Application
