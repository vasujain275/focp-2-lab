// Define a class hierarchy representing vehicles, where Vehicle is the base class, Car inherits from Vehicle, and ElectricCar inherits from Car. Implement the drive() method in Vehicle class to print a message, "Vehicle is being driven‚Äù. Add additional methods to the Car class: honk() to simulate honking and refuel() to simulate refueling. Add additional method to ElectricCar class: charge() to charging. Demonstrate the use of inheritance by creating objects of ElectricCar class and invoking all methods from Vehicle, Car and ElectricCar.
